    <p>Having reached the ripe age of 45, I've finally decided what I want to be when I grow up.  I've been fortunate to enjoy a successful career in retail management for the last 25 years, and am now looking forward to a second career that focuses more on service to my community.  My goal is to complete a Bachelors, and hopefully Master's as well, in Mathematics.  Once I complete my degree, I will then pursue teacher's certification, with the goal of teaching at the secondary level in the St Louis city school district.  I am completing an Associate's degree in general transfer studies at St Louis Community College this semester, and am very excited by the possibility of completing my bachelors at Washington University. </p>
    <p>I began my college education in 1990, majoring in English.  Financial issues within my family forced me to pause my studies after one year, and that pause quickly morphed into a full stop.  In 2010, I decided to finally restart my studies, and I've taken one or two classes a semester since then.  I've gone through a few changes of major changes along the way, but have consistently been drawn back towards a passion for the STEM subjects.  Working full-time while pursuing my degree has been a rewarding challenge, and I've greatly enjoyed the self-discipline and time management skills I've developed along the way. I am proud of my grade average, and am graduating as a member of the Dean's list.  I have also been a proud member of Phi Theta Kappa. </p>
    <p>Math and science explain the relationships within the universe, and I'm consistently dazzled by the numerical dances that make up higher mathematics.  Mathematical thinking is a highly beneficial skill that can be applied to almost any endeavor or problem.  Whether writing music, coding software, or understanding the global economy, the ability to think mathematically is critical.  I would be greatly honored to have Washington University be part of my journey as I work to develop this passion within myself and others. </p>
