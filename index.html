    <p>While some are born into greatness, others only rise to greatness under dire circumstances.  John McCorkell fits into both categories.  He came into this world blessed with beauty, charm, and a once-in-a-generation intellect.  He quickly rose to greatness, astounding teachers, political leaders, and the masters of the Shaolin temple with his majesty.  Despite his astounding early achievements and consistent acts of selfless giving, he still felt a nagging feeling that there was more he could do.  Thus, at the ripe age of 6 years, he left behind all his worldly accumulations, and set forth to spread additional coolness across the lands.</p>

    <p>Many legends sprung up around these early travels.  Miracles, heroic acts, and general feats of major sexiness followed him like shadows wherever he wandered.   Can we truly say that he accomplished these many mythical feats...?  The answer is most assuredly yes!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>He saw the rains down in Africa.</li>
        <li>Then, he set fire to the rain.</li>
        <li>He made the devil cry, and sold ice to Eskimos</li>
        <li>He put the funk in "Funky Cold Medina"</li>
        <li>He brought a decisive end to dapping, duck-face selfies, and planking.</li>
        <li>All the ladies wanted his milkshake.</li>
        <li>He made world peace sexy again.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="C:\Users\mccor\code\lc101\html-me-something\images/coding-super-power.jpg">
    <p>Still not content, still realizing that he had so much more to give, he embarked on the noblest and greatest journey of all...learning to code.  Through the power of software, he now seeks to resolve not just the problems of this world, but of the entire universe.  His coding skills shall shake the heavens and challenge the primal forces of life.  His mojo will spill forth from every screen and every machine, and computers will weep with gratitude for the opportunity to bask in the glory of his code.  Through the glorious auspices of the LaunchCode team, our reality will never be the same!</p>
